Arduino is used as a microcontroller for servos and gyros
The MPU-6050 was connected to the end of a robot arm created
from 3 high torque servos and this code was loaded to the arduino

If attached to a person the arm balances something like a drink
out in front of the person.

This project is used more as a joke than anything and is an 
attempt to recreate this video:

Improvements:

Find stronger servos or motors that can actually hold about 1 pound.
-This is the weight of a coke can and would make it more realistic LOL
